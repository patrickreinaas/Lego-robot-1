Code for our first work assignment in relation to the robot-lego in the subject: "Teambasert Samhandling".
This was an introduction to programming with the lego-robot while using Python as the programming language. 
Our assignment consisted of three tasks:

1. Print "Hello World" on the LCD-screen attached to the robot.
2. Perform a single full square movement.
3. Stop and speak "Have a nice day", before exiting the program.
