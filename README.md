The code for our first work assignment in relation to the robot-lego in "Teambasert Samhandling".
This was an introduction to programming the lego-robot using Python as a programming language. 
Our task was to make the robot print "Hello World" on the LCD-screen. Thereafter make it perform a single full square movement, before coming to a stop and saying "Have a nice day" and then exiting the program.
