Code for our first work assignment in relation to the robot-lego in the subject: "Teambasert Samhandling".
This was an introduction to programming with the lego-robot while using Python as the programming language. 
Our assignment consisted of three tasks:

1. Print "Hello World" on the LCD-screen attached to the robot.
2. Perform a single full square movement.
3. Stop and speak "Have a nice day", before exiting the program.

Reflecting back at this assignment, I have learned/experienced:
- How to setup and IDE and use an plugin
- Use Python to program something that I can see, hear and touch
- Collaborate to reach a commmon
