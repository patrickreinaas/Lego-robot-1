Code for our first work assignment in relation to the robot-lego in the subject: "Teambasert Samhandling".
This was an introduction to programming with the lego-robot while using Python as the programming language.

Our assignment consisted of:
1. Printing "Hello World" on the LCD-screen attached to the robot.
2. Making the robot perform a single full square movement.
3. Making the robot say "Have a nice day" after performing step 2.

Reflecting back at this assignment, I have learned/experienced:
- How to setup an IDE and use a plugin for an IDE
- Use Python to program something that I can see, hear and touch
- Collaborate to reach a common goal
